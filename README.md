Application description

##User Story

As a blogger, I need a secure place to share my thoughts and ideas, and get feedback on my writing.

As a consumer of creative content, I want to read material that is presented by people who share my interests.

As a developer and writer, I want to find a place where I can network with other professionals.


##Acceptance Criteria

When I navigate to the application, I am presented with the landing page where I can see the most recent blogs posted by other users.

If I click on the login button, I am taken to a working login/sign up page.

When I submit a sign up form, my login credentials are saved in a secure database.

Once I submit the correct login criteria, I am redirected to a more personalized landing page with my profile image, a link to my blog page, and a sign out button in the nav bar.

When I navigate to my blog page, I am presented with a list of my blog posts, as well as a form to create a new post and a form for uploading a new profile image.

When I complete and submit the new blog form, a new blog post is generated at the top of the list of existing posts.

When I upload an image file from the form in the nav bar, my profile image is updated using the new image file.

When I click the 'new comment' button, I am presented with a form which appends a comment to the comments section of the relative blog post.

When I click the logout button, I am signed out of my page and redirected to the landing page.
